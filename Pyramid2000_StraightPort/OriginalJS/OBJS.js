// The code assumes a specific order to the objects. For instance, "WATER IN BOTTLE" must be placed in object lists
// after "BOTTLE" for it to read correctly. Objects are kept here in an array (instead of a map-by-name) to preserve 
// the original order. 

// If an object is packable then it has a "short" description used with "inventory".
// If an object is visible in a room then it has a "long" description. The room description for room 56
// includes a description of the stream object fixed in it, and thus "stream_56" has no long description 
// to print.
